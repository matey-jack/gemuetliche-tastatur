# Gem√ºtliches Tastaturlayout for ChromeOS

For compatibility with different Chromebooks and their keyboards, this layout does not include the thumb-operated "e".
It also remains to be researched if (and how) the third layer can be used and if we can have the left-hand "AltGr".  

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xkeyboard-config/xkeyboard-config/-/blob/master/symbols/de?ref_type=heads
let's try "layouts": \["de"] and if it doesn't work, use "de(basic)"

Result of experiment: apparently the "remap extension" is based upon "background script" which is deprecated and removed in manifest version 3.
And Manifest version 2 is already being deactivated with a hard deadline next year.
So just following the Readme guide is not a solution.

Let's see later if there is another way.
