The official source repo is there: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xkeyboard-config/

mirror for pampered millenials:
https://github.com/freedesktop/xkeyboard-config

Contributions, however, happen via patch files and Bugzilla: 
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?product=xkeyboard-config&component=General

also useful is the mailing list: https://groups.google.com/a/listserv.bat.ru/forum/#!forum/xkb

since the original source requires some build machinery, we start prototyping on a copy of the configuration as delivered with Ubuntu 18.04. Hope to merge this soon, of course!
